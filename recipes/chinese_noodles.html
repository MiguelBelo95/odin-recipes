      <li>vegetable oil</li>
      <li>4 green onions, thinly sliced</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Boil ramen noodles for 3 minutes, or until softened, without flavor
        packets. Reserve flavor packets. Drain noodles, and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small skillet. Scramble eggs in a bowl. Cook
        and stir in hot oil until firm. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate skillet, heat 1 teaspoon of oil over medium heat. Cook and
        stir green onions in oil for 2 to 3 minutes, or until softened. Transfer
        to a separate dish, and set aside. Heat another teaspoon of cooking oil
        in the same skillet. Cook and stir the the carrots, peas, and bell
        peppers separately in the same manner, setting each aside when done.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine 2 tablespoons sesame oil with 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a
        separate skillet or wok. Fry noodles in oil for 3 to 5 minutes over
        medium heat, turning regularly. Sprinkle soy sauce, sesame oil, and
        desired amount of reserved ramen seasoning packets over noodles, and
        toss to coat. Add vegetables, and continue cooking, turning frequently,
        for another 5 minutes.
